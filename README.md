Current State
The game is in active development with basic mechanics such as movement, attack, and collision detection working. The animations for both the Kree (player) and the Bee (opponent) are currently functional, including the ability to flip the opponent.

Still Working: Further enhancements such as advanced opponent AI, special attacks, and additional game mechanics are planned.
